	<p id="quote">“He who knows not and knows not he knows not, he is a fool; shun him.
He who knows not and knows he knows not, he is simple; teach him.
He who knows and knows not that he knows, he is asleep; awaken him.
He who knows and knows that he knows, he is wise; follow him.”<br><br>-- Bruce Lee, Tao of Jeet Kune Do</p><br>
